From the fianle steps of leanring our tool i think i can come to an end on what were learning which is sprite animation. I have made a tresting sprite with my own drawing as a tester and i think it turned out pretty well conisdering p5play would only allow animations by frames, like a stop-motion at least.

(code below)

```
let player
let catman

funtion preload(){

 catman = loadAnimation(["Untitled86_20250112213346.png","Untitled86_20250112213340.png","Untitled86_20250112213336.png", "Untitled86_20250112213328.png", "IMG_2599.png"])
}

function setup(){
 player = new Sprite();

  player.addAni(catman);
}
```
since we were most anxious on how we would animate a certain part of the project like the action and stuff. but i think now we got the animation for sprites covered and the background as well.

- the next thing for me to do is acutally  try to make progress on the freedom project, Qilin wanted backgrounds so ill start on making the backgrounds, and we need a way to make the action of the gambling happing so we need to work on the frames of that and ill try animating the backgrounds.

  # EDP

  right now were at a point that we can say almost about 90% done of our tools and we can get started on animating the parts and putting them into place and trying them out eariier so that we won't have any difficulties over when we do it later on. as i said before we need backgrounds for some scenes, and to also animate the background, we got the sprites in tact, and we just need the sprites in action. so i would say weere at the design process now

# Skills

skills that we need right now is to draw the rest of the sprites and to also animate them using out tools to see the results before the final action, also like a draft that we need to plan out and set everything nup before we can actually glue them down. i think thats it for now in our progress

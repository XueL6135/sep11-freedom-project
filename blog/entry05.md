So far in my progress of using my tool I have used it to make an animated background and along with sound, I have figured out how to move from one screen to another, and I have figured out how to animate my sprites to move [them](https://github.com/XueL6135/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/p5play/sketch.js)

Me and my partner have finished our [MVP](https://github.com/kateek5417/sep11-cat-project/blob/main/index.html) as we have made it work and that includes with the system on how you can pull from a random varieties of different cats and how certain rarities can give you different types of cats within that rarity. We made the sprites to be interactive and made it work so that when it clicks it works in a certain way.

# EDP
Right now for our engineering design process, we are hoping or maybe to merge our two parts of our freedom project and we need to figure out a way to do that to make sure that it doesnâ€™t clash so it can work smoothly. We are trying to figure out how to hop from one place to another example: how to hop from javascript to HTMl how to merge them together, because whenever we are trying to include something in the HTML it goes outside of the screen.

# SKills

## Time management 

With exams of classes we are hoping to make it a time where we can work on it with no worries and try to complete it on time within schedule.

## multitask 

Along with time management, we also need to try and multitask, because along with time management we need to know how to manage both tasks inside of the school and outside of school, with some of us doing SYEP, interviews, and doing certain programs in the process.

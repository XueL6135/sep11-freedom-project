# Context 
This year while were doing javascript, The first thing that came to my mind was "a game", a game that i enjoy and also create. One example of the game idea that came ot my mind was "Genshin", its a gme that both inpspired me and some of my friends to actually think of the game and actually make it. genshin is a type of game that reflects on collecting, and grinding for your favorite characters, the more you grind in the game the more possibility that you can collect your characters.

so for this year's freedom project me, katee,Ellen, and Qilin decided that we should do a game based on the sysytem. were going to create a cat game which involves the basics like collecting and grinding. the user spends the cat food to obtain differnt types/rarity of the cats ranging from R(rare), SR(super rare), SSR(super super rare). since the game has two parts we decided to seperate the two parts. One focuses on collecting the cat food. one focuses on making the system to use the collecting cat food to spend on the different types of cats. So me and katee are doing the system while Qilin and ellen are working on the cat food.

we wanted to not only do our part but also overall help out with the whole game, there will be a total of 15 cats and me, katee, ellen are going to split up and draw all of the cats digitally and by hand. **Part A** will be about collecting cat food as informed and it will be about the user collecting the cat food with certain obstacles in their way and **part B** is the system is when the player uses the collected cat food they are getting from part A to get the different types of cats.

## Tool

The tool that Me and Katee are going to use is [P5play](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html) and Qilin and Ellen will use Kaboom for theirs. P5play can be mostly learned from their website and later on it can also be learned through [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsTXsHxgWJc). P5play is a physics tool where it allows the user to make sprites do many things such as how gravity affects the sprite or how this sprite affects another sprite by either bumping into each other or just falling off of one another. 

P5play has its [tinkering](https://editor.p5js.org/) tool on the website for you to use and experiment with the different codes from my notes on the tool most of the code affects the sprites one way or another, by changing their gravity you can definitely make them work differently and how they move differently you can also change how they interact with each other. Sprites can also be many things that you want by even using your own pictures, p5play has its number by color where each letter is a color where you can use to create a picture of your choice.

## Game

Our game idea is simple we have two parts, Part A and Part B, Part A is about collecting the Cat food which that will help us in part B, Part A will include a map for the cat to collect cat food while the player has to avoid obstacles and many things on the map that will slow them down, The player will have boosts across the board to help them collect the cat food, the player will have a time limit of 1 minute per gameplay.

In Part B the player will use the cat food that they collected to use it to get more cat avatars for them to collect, there will be at least 15 cat avatars to collect. There are 7 rares, 5 super rares, 3 super super rares, and the percentage of them getting it will increase from rare being the more chance to get while super super rare will be a lot harder to get. One pull will be 10 cat food while 100 cat food will be 10 pulls, after they have done at least 50 pulls the player will be guaranteed a random SSR cat avatar.

# EDP

Our Engineering process right now is that we are still planning out the layout of our game, adjusting changes, adding or making plans about the details while learning about our tool. The game right now is still in draft and has not been fully published yet for the plan.

# Skills

Right now the biggest thing we need to focus on is on **communication** because some of us have different classes that they need to work on and to study for so they are extra busy. We need to check up on each other so that we know what we are doing and if the other party needs help with something. (we have discord for that)
And since right now we are only planning we want to get the things we can get done first which is the skill of **art**. Not only we want our game to code nicely we also wanted it to look nice. we decided to split the draiwngs, three of us will do the drawing by dividing the work by 5 cats each.

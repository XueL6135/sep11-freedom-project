## Expo Elevator Pitch
during presentation, I had a feeling that I had to speak pretty louder than I had to speak before during my in class presentations because 1. The cafeteria was loud and everyone was talking over each other and it was just a lot that you have to talk over to the judges. 2. when speaking loudly, you have to know what you're gonna say before you speak out because you're speaking out for everyone to hear so you want them to hear what you're telling them in a loud clear voice so that they can hear you clearly. The one thing that I really liked about the expo elevator pitch was that it was more to a smaller audience which I liked it better and I felt more comfortable talking to them so maybe that's why I feel like I present it better during the expo. 

Having a [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117igknNRQwWthQaOVm1sDASUPWZ2YJczcscMUoqMtRM/edit?usp=drivesdk) for the elevator pitch was really helpful and I think that resetting it out was a really good practice to help me get a good voice for the presentation.

## in class presentation
As always, just as last year, it feels really sort of nervous to percent in front of a lot of people, and I was still getting nervous and my heart will still be really really fast during the presentations, as they say on the outside, you might look like your person really well and you might look fine but on the inside you're freaking out on what others would think. But I think generally people don't care if you mess up during presentations because in the end, they just want to see your product and how it works, so as long as you give them a clear picture of what you're trying to present and a clear motive, they will understand it, I felt like I did better than what I did last year because I feel more confident in knowing what to say. I felt like if you practice presenting before presenting to others I feel like that helps a lot a lot more because it helps with getting to know what you're gonna say so that you don't stop and hesitate for words.

and as always, I feel like whatever you're [presenting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kNJ3U2zIFahoc7eQWihP7v_bDOIq0wE5Y6k-PR0tRYw/edit?slide=id.g357ea61c767_0_6#slide=id.g357ea61c767_0_6) will match your presentation speech and how it connects to you.

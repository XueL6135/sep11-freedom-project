# context
 These past few weeks Ive been having an interesting experiment with my tool as im just experimenting with some videos as well as trying them out for myself and changing up some codes to see if theres a limit or extent. [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=a9HOemx9wk-jo5N2&v=XsTXsHxgWJc&feature=youtu.be) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBt_w3SELnw) video one is about the many effects you can do while you press a key. and video 2 is mostly about keyboard control. and you can control the ship using your keys.

this was made possible due to `mouse.pressed` and `world.gravity.y = 5` you can use x but either one works

 by using `s.x = mouse.x` i can make them spawn where ever i want by just clicking on the screen at the same time the .y works too
- i found out that `random(30,100)` is different from what i expected, the comma is the numbers between 30 and 100 and it can be placed if you want anything to spawn between that number either it can be the x-axis or the y-axis.

then there is `sprite.amount` is pretty fun to polay with, if you click on the screen it will show many of one thing with that amount and it will not go over that amount.

see how theres a lot of the poop emojis in one click but not the second?, its alright cause the number of those emojis was the amount that i set the maximum of that amount.

I learned next on animation and how we can use our keys to make our sprite animate in certain ways. by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBt_w3SELnw) the main snippets of code i got from it as well as using that to make something 
`if(kb.pressing("left"))ship.rotation -=2;` to make the sprite rotate when it moves
`sprite.applyForce(-30)` can make the sprite movement change

For this winter i hopped to able to create something new with p5play, theres a lot of demos on some different games that we can try out andi was wondering if i can get to and able to learn not all of them but just5 some that im able to understand and some that i can able to learn in my own free time because i want to study for the SAT. I wan't to finish up some art for the game as well.

# EDP

For our next step i was hoping to get our process to learn the code done and were hoping to get it done and we can start planning out our code, but right now we hvaen't thought about it yet but i can feel that we are gettin closer. For now we just have to be patient with the process and see how things go ahead. Right now not all of us have completed the art designs of how the view screen is going to be so right now we want to get that done first maybe over the break and once we get the art process done we can get to the point of planning out the code and hopefully it won't be much of challenge.

# skills

since we need to finish upn our art design process we need all the **creativity** we can get to finish the drafts and complete them before the end of the winter break.we also need to make sure that we stay **focused** on task with also our other classes and hopefully we can multitask maybe but all we need is right now is to lock in and focus on our work, then we can start with our code.

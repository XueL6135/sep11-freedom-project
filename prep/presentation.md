# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* in a question starting off on similar interests that people would like to answer. (do you like () )

## Product
* we will show it off by giving it a quick demo and how it works/explaing the simple steps

## Process
* giving off the tools that we used
* using the tools to explain how we adchieve the product that we intended it to
* the struggles

  -code-
* giving code snippits and screenshots on the slides sowing some of the code that we did over our freedom project
* breaking it down the code into sections

## Conclusion
* (URL to project)
* takeaways
  - the struggle of combing both of our codes together and how something look and work so smoothly is actually a very hard system behind it that one needs to research and take hours of time to perfect the system so that it works smoothly on both sides. -once we were completed with both sides of our MVP we needed to connect them together and we needed to figure out how to connect them together, (it wasn't easy).
  - 
  - your going to crash/ burnt out at some point so don't really push yourself for hours on that desk trying to figure out one thing, sometimes its really better to take a breather and work on it tomorrow so you feel more motivated and in a better condition- from us we woukd spend time trying to figure out what was bugging our code because theres this one piece of line that would 't cooperate with the others so that made it crash and we had to spend a lot of time just to figure out what was wrong and by the time we were trying to figure it out an hour went by.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"

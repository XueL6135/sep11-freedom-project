# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Xue Lin**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **p5play** in order to help me make **cat gambler**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* our game shows awareness that in real life something like the "gambling" system
* Our game minimize the factors of it and makes it more so that the users don't have to spend their own pocket money
* the game shows that you have to work for something that you want.
##### CONS
* although it is a game, it might get addicting because of the system and you wanna do it over and over and over again.
* it's the game itself is sort of toxic as it shows the gambling system and just how life can revolve around it.
